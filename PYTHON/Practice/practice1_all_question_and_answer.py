# a. Static
# b. Dynamic
# c. Manual
# d. Implicit
# 2. What is the correct syntax for an if statement in Python?
# a. if x > 5 then:
# b. if x > 5:
# c. if (x > 5) {
# d. if x > 5 do:
# 3. What is the output of this code bool(“Hello”)?
# a. True
# b. False
# c. None
# d. Error
# 4. What will happen if the following code is executed?
# for i in range(1, 10, -3):
# print(i)
# a. It will print numbers from 1 to 10 with a step of -3.
# b. It will throw a ValueError because the step is negative and the start is less
# than the end.
# c. It will throw a SyntaxError.
# d. It will print nothing.
# 5. What is the output of this code print("Hello" + 1530)?
# a. Hello1530
# b. Error
# c. None
# d. 1530Hello
# 6. Which of these is NOT true about a compiler?
# a. It generates machine code.
# b. It is slower than an interpreter during the first execution.
# c. It executes the program line by line.
# d. Errors are displayed after the entire code is compiled.
# 7. What happens if the following code is executed and the user inputs "ten"?

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print(f"The double of the number is {number * 2}")
# a. It will print "The double of the number is ten".
# b. It will throw a ValueError.
# c. It will print 20.
# d. It will throw a TypeError.

# 8. What will be the output if the user enters 10, 20, and 30?

# a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# c = int(input("Enter the third number: "))
# print("The average is:", (a + b + c) / 3)

# a. The average is 20
# b. The average is 20.0
# c. 20
# d. 60
# 9. What does the “is” operator compare?
# a. The values of two objects
# b. The memory locations (identity) of two objects
# c. Both values and memory locations
# d. The type of two objects
# 10. What will the following code output?

# a = 0
# b = 0
# print(a > b)

# a. True
# b. False
# c. Error
# d. None

# Section B:
# 1. Write a Python function to reverse a given string.
# 2. Write a function that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a while loop.
# 3. Write a Python program to determine whether the speed limit exceeds 110 km per
# hour. If the speed exceeds 110, then fine = 300, otherwise fine = 0. Display fine.
# 4. Draw a Flowchart and Write a Python Program for Multiplication Tables up to 10.
# 5. Write a program that prompts the user to prints all numbers between 1 and 50 that
# are divisible by 3.
# 6. Ask the user to enter a number. If the number is even, print "The number is even." If
# the number is odd, print "The number is odd." Continue asking for a number until
# the user enters 0.
# 7. Write a program to count how many times the number 7 appears in a list using a while
# loop.
# 8. Write a program that finds the sum of digits in a number.
# 9. Write a python program to ask for the score input and print the respective grade as
# follow:

# Score Grade
# Above 80 A
# 60 - 79 B
# 40 – 59 C
# Below 40 D
# 10. Accept 2 input values from user and do arithmetic operation. (+, -, *, /, %). (HINT: simple
# calculator)
